      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>First and foremost, I'm a girl with many interests and I want my site to reflect this. I am a proud city girl, a food lover (cooking and baking included), scientist, a reader, a secret writer, a traveler, and an aspiring programmer to name a few things.</p>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Washington in June of 2015 with a degree in biochemistry. My favorite subject was chemistry and I was on track for pharmacy school. However, there's nothing like a little world travelling to put your life and goals into perspective.</p>
      <p>A whole two days after my graduation, I got on a plane to Europe ready to see everything I possibly could in 3 months. I knew it would be fun, but I wasn't expecting it to change my perspective so dramatically. Talking to so many new and interesting people about their lives and aspirations as well as mine opened my mind and made me think critically about what I really wanted in life</p>
      <p>In the end, I've made a fork in my repository. I am on the computer science branch now, but that is not to say I will never go back to chemistry and pharmacy. I hope to merge the two, and help promote drug literacy through advocacy and easily accessible information.</p>
